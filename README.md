# OOP-project-template
A template for a Yr11 OOP project

You should fork this repository into your own GitHub account.  This will give you a set of folders which each include the items you need to put in those folders - it might help you stay organised and on-track to complete this task.

## Repository contents:
- Code: You can put your Python (or other language) code directly in the root folder (or create a subfolder if you prefer)
- [Design documentation](./Design documentation): This folder should include your Planning & design tools (images and tables for things like DFD, structure chart, data dictionary etc) listed in the 'Designing' section of the task description.  If you [use the right markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) you can place images inline in the Readme or a file of your own, otherwise just name your image files appropriately and add them to the Design documentation folder.
- [Programming practices](./Programming practices): Add your descriptions and explanations of how you used a range of good programming practices in your project. Label each practice used and include a screenshot or code snippet that clearly shows its use related to your description and explanation.
- [OOP principles](./OOP principles): Add your descriptions and explanations of how you used a range of OOP principles in your project. For each principle, include a very small code snippet that highlights the principle.
